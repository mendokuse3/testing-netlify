# `CandiDate`

## `Description:`

"CandiDate" provides users a chance to see who and how well they best match with out of today's main Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees. Completed in a 3 day sprint, a UX/UI team using Adobe XD designed this beautiful, fun, yet sophisticated prototype. Created to raise voter awareness, we hoped to reach the undecided voter between the ages of 18-26 years old. A user can answer a series of questions to find out who they best match with, and if inspired to exercise their right, find out how to register and vote in their state.
